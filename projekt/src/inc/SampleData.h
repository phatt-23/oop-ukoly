Written in a student-friendly style, the book emphasises the understanding of ideas over excessively formal treatment while thoroughly covering the material required in an introductory algorithms course. Popular puzzles are used to motivate students' interest and strengthen their skills in algorithmic problem solving.",

The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeâ€”of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \"smells\" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.",
